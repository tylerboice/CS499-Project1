CS 499 Deep Learning - Project 1
Hey guys, I don't have any of your contact info, but we haven't talked about this project and it's due tomorrow. How are we going to split this up and do it?

-I made a basic gradient decent file, can you guys check to make sure it's good?

I'm taking a look at the gradient decent file now. Any ideas where our data set is coming from? If so I can take care of filling the arrays ~Benngy

Also, if anybody wants to start like a group chat or something my # is 520-561-7953

-Also, could you implement a method to plug the data sets into x and y? I don't know how to do this
