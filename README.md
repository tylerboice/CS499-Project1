CS 499 Deep Learning - Project 1
Hey guys, I don't have any of your contact info, but we haven't talked about this project and it's due tomorrow. How are we going to split this up and do it?

-I made a basic gradient decent file, can you guys check to make sure it's good?
-Also, could you implement a method to plug the data sets into x and y? I don't know how to do this
-Here is the report link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AUXKt9dgjzOpEc7OcgSYeFbBE2G53KSaVfiHMwUKFbw/edit?usp=sharing
